#### Biography

I am currently a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at [USTC](https://www.qschina.cn/en/universities/university-science-technology-china).

Currently I'm interning at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) in the Social Computing Group, under the mentorship of Dr. [Xie Xing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xingx/) and Prof. [Wang Xiting](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/wangxt). Here, I have been involved in cutting-edge research focused on enhancing the interpretability of large language models (LLMs) and improving the interpretability of AI systems. These efforts align closely with my commitment to developing AI technologies that are both beneficial and accessible to society at large.

I will be joining [HKUST](https://www.qschina.cn/en/universities/hong-kong-university-science-technology) as a PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering in 2024 fall semester, under the supervision of Prof. [Wang Shuai](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=shuai-wang-shuaiw).

I aspire to contribute significantly to the field of AI, particularly in making LLMs more interpretable and reliable. I am eager to explore the vast possibilities that lie at the intersection of AI technology and societal benefit, and I am committed to leveraging my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the world.
