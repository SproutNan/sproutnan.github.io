#### Biography

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at [HKUST](https://www.qschina.cn/en/universities/hong-kong-university-science-technology) under the supervision of Prof. [Wang Shuai](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=shuai-wang-shuaiw).

Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Technology at [USTC](https://www.qschina.cn/en/universities/university-science-technology-china). During my studies, I interned at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) in the Social Computing Group, where I was mentored by Dr. [Xie Xing](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xingx/) and Prof. [Wang Xiting](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/wangxt). My research focused on enhancing the interpretability of large language models (LLMs) and improving AI system interpretability, driven by my dedication to developing accessible AI technologies for societal benefit.

I aspire to significantly contribute to AI, particularly in making LLMs more interpretable and reliable. I am eager to explore the intersection of AI technology and societal good, aiming to leverage my skills and research to make a positive impact.
